/** Q10
	 * This program calculates and prints the product of odd numbers from 1 to 15.
		(Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 15)
		
		Problem Flow:
		Start from 1 to 15
		Increment by 2 to get odd numbers
		Multiply all odd numbers
		Print the final product
		
		Input / Output Example:
		Output:
		Product of odd numbers from 1 to 15 = 2027025
		(Odd numbers: 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 × 11 × 13 × 15 = 2027025)
